## Efficiency
### 1. Load Balancer
A load balancer will be used to redcue each server's burden so that the servers become more fast to response to users' request. We use the master and slave in Mysql to keep the data consistency.

### 2. Database Optimization
* Connection Pooling
* Prepared Statements

### 3. Cache when search
Cache the sugested list in javascript for past queries and reuse it when possible. So the autocomplete suggestion will response more fast and the burden of the server will also be reduced.


## Security
### 1. Use reCAPTCHA
### 2. Encrypted password 
Encrypt Users' password in DB, and login should verify user input with encrypted password
### 3. Encrypted Transmission
* Use Post 
* Use Https (I closed this because there is not valid certificate)

## Innovation
### Crawler for movie poster
I use IMDB's movie database so the movie ID in my database is same with the IMDB. I want to add movie posters to each movies so that users have better experience. But there is no open IMDB API for movie posters. So I write a crawler to get each movies' poster by their IMDB ID.
